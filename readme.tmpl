# debrepo

A nix flake that is used to create an apt repository for debian-based
distros containing a small selection of packages.

A live and mostly up-to-date version of the repo this flake produces is
available on `apt.noql.net`. It can used by adding the following to
`/etc/apt/sources.list`:

```
deb [trusted=yes] https://apt.noql.net/all all main
```

Make sure to install `ca-certificates` to be able to use https sources,
and run `apt update` afterwards.

## Goals
The packages produced here are statically compiled, and target
both amd64 and arm64 architectures. The arm64 packages are
cross-compiled on amd64 build machines.

## Package selection
The packages that are added here are generally
anti-censorship/proxy, networking, encryption/privacy related tools. The
selection is updated very regularly.

If there's a tool that would be appropriate to add, please file an
issue.
